<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Balloon-expandable Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare-metal Stents</li><li>Drug-eluting Stents</li><li>Bioabsorbable Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The balloon-expandable stents market comprises three primary types: bare-metal stents, drug-eluting stents, and bioabsorbable stents. Bare-metal stents provide essential structural support to keep arteries open but may re-narrow over time. Drug-eluting stents are coated with medication to prevent restenosis by releasing the drug over time. Bioabsorbable stents, designed to dissolve within the body, support the artery temporarily, reducing long-term complications associated with permanent implants. Each type addresses specific patient needs and conditions in vascular interventions.</p></p>
