<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Carbon Brakes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drum Brakes</li><li>Disk Brakes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aircraft carbon brakes market primarily features two types: drum brakes and disk brakes. Drum brakes consist of a cylindrical drum that rotates with the wheel, using frictional pads to slow down the aircraft. In contrast, disk brakes utilize a flat-disc design with pads that clamp onto the rotating disc for braking. Disk brakes tend to offer superior performance, including improved heat dissipation and reduced weight, which make them more prevalent in modern aircraft applications, enhancing safety and efficiency.</p></p>
