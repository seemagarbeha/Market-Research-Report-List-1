<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Height Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The height sensors market is primarily divided into two types: contact and non-contact sensors. Contact type height sensors rely on physical touch to measure the height of an object, providing accurate readings but potentially causing wear or damage. In contrast, non-contact type sensors utilize technologies like laser, ultrasonic, or infrared to gauge height without physical contact, preserving the integrity of the measured object and offering faster measurements. Each type serves distinct applications based on precision, sensitivity, and operational requirements.</p></p>
